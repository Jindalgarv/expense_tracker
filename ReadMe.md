# 💸 SplitLite

A premium, elegant, and mobile-responsive group expense-splitting PWA (inspired by Splitwise). Designed with modern dark glassmorphism, native-feeling micro-animations, and a robust backend engine to split bills, track friendships, simplify group debts, and resolve expenses in seconds.

Developed and designed with 🤍 by **Garv Jindal**.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Precision Math Splitting Engine**: Split bills equally, by exact amounts, by percentage, or by custom share ratios. Includes protection against decimal rounding drift (assigning remainder cents to the payer).
* **Greedy Debt Simplification**: A robust matrix algorithm that matches all group debtors and creditors, simplifying net outstanding balances into the absolute minimum number of peer-to-peer transfers.
* **Self-Contained Google OAuth2 SSO**: Secure, zero-dependency one-click social authentication running purely on Python standard libraries without external package bloat.
* **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Installed directly on iOS and Android with maskable high-res logos, service-worker caching, offline readiness, and custom standalone status bar configurations.
* **Launch Splash Screen**: Dynamic fullscreen session launch overlay `#0f1117` complete with scaling logo spring entries, staggered fade-ins, and a looping, glowing pulsing heart `🤍`.
* **Analytics & Timelines**: Seamless activity feeds tracking group logs, friendly ledger balances, and comprehensive monthly category distribution charts.
